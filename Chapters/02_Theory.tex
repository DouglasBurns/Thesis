\chapter{Theoretical overview}
\label{ch:Theory}

The \textit{standard model of particle physics} (\SM{}) is an elegant attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the Universe.
At the heart of the model are the base constituents of matter, the \textit{elementary particles} and the interactions between them, the \textit{forces}.
The \SM{} does a fantastic job at describing current experimental measurements across a large range of energies, from the high energies currently probed at particle colliders to the interactions we see in the macroscopic world.
The \SM{} is an incomplete model, however. 
It does not, for example, describe the gravitational interactions between particles, nor does it fully explain the matter-antimatter imbalance seen in the Universe.
Previous discrepancies in the \SM{}, have lead to predictions and discoveries in nature, such as the existence of three families of quarks due to the lack of CP-violation in the two quark family \SM{}. 
In this way, the \SM{} has evolved over the last half-century since it was first postulated, to incorporate new experimental evidence to become a more complete description of nature and it will continue to do so for many years to come.
This chapter will discuss the particles which make up the \SM{} and how they interact with each other, forming the complete model.
Some drawbacks of the \SM{} will then be highlighted, before moving on to the physics of top quarks and their cross sections.
