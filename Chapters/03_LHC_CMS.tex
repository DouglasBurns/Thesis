\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider and the Compact Muon Solenoid}
\label{ch:LHCCMS}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is primarily a proton-proton circular collider, situated at the Conseil Europ$\acute{\text{e}}$en pour la Recherche Nucl$\acute{\text{e}}$aire (CERN) on the French-Swiss border. 
It is built 100\m{} underground in the tunnels that housed the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider and is currently the worlds largest machine, with an accelerator ring 27\km{} in circumference. 
There are 4 main experiments operating at the LHC; two multipurpose general detectors, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A Toriodal Large ApparatuS (ATLAS), a precision \bquark{} physics experiment (LHCb), and finally a detector dedicated to heavy ion physics, A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE). 
The location of LHC and each of these experiments with respect to the local topology is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:LHCPicture}.

This chapter will highlight a brief history of the LHC, how it is operated to produce collisions in the experimental caverns and the current data-taking environment. A description is given of the subdetectors that form the CMS experiment.
