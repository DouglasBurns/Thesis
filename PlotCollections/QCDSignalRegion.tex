Also shown as a comparison is the data-subtracted \QCD{} estimate from the alternate control region. Below each of the distributions, the ratio of the two \QCD predictions is shown. This ratio gives an estimation of the \QCD{} normalisation uncertainty by the displacement from unity and was taken to be $\pm50\%$ shown by the gold band. The \QCD{} shape uncertainty is given by the spread of the ratio, taken to be $\pm30\%$ shown by the grey band.]{The prediction of multijet \QCD{} in the alternate control region from the nominal control region for each event variable in the electron channel.
